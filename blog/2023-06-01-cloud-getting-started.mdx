Now that QuestDB Cloud is
[generally available](https://twitter.com/QuestDb/status/1660688060114169858),
you can claim up to $200 of free credits to use towards a QuestDB instance for
your own time-series workloads. This tutorial will show you how to get started
with your first database instance in QuestDB Cloud!

If you're unfamiliar with the concept of a time-series database, I recommend
checking out our glossary for the
[Time-Series Database](/glossary/time-series-database/).

## Registration

To access our Cloud, you can navigate to https://cloud.questdb.com, where you
will be greeted by a welcome page. Click the "Secure Login" button to get
started! From here, you can either choose to create an account using your email
and password, or use a Google account to log into the Cloud.

## Creating your first database

Once you've created an account, you'll be forwarded to the database listing
page. This is where all of your active databases will be shown. However, since
you need to explicitly create a database, and you just signed up in the previous
step, this page should be empty.

<Screenshot

  title="Database Listing page"
  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/main-page-empty.webp"
/>

_Note that by default, we allow users to create at most 2 databases. If you
require additional instances, please reach out to us so we can increase your
organization's limit. See the [Help and Support section](#help-and-support) for
the various ways to contact us._

Let's click the "Create new instance" button to get started!

<Screenshot
  alt="QuestDB Cloud Create Instance Page (Basic)"
  title="Create Instance page"
  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/create-instance-basic.webp"
/>

On this page, you can name your new database (or use the default
randomly-generated name like I did) and also choose the region in which you want
to deploy it. As of writing, we support the equivalents of AWS's `us-east-2` and
`eu-west-1`, but please contact us if you need a different region and we'll do
our best to accommodate.

In case you're not sure how you want to spec your database instance, we provide
3 preset configurations for you to get started. These will all launch with the
latest available QuestDB version.

Since this is only a tutorial, and we want to keep your costs low to get the
most out of your free credits, we can just create an "Entry level" database for
demonstration purposes. For more granular control over your database instance's
specs, click the "Advanced" button on the top right to tweak parameters like the
number of CPUs, amount of RAM, or QuestDB version that you want to run.

The "Entry level" option is already pre-selected for you, let's go ahead and
click "Create Instance". You should now be forwarded to the database detail
page.

<Screenshot
  alt="QuestDB Cloud Database Detail Page (Provisioning)"
  title="Database Detail page"
  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/database-detail-provisioning.webp"
/>

Notice that the database is in a "Provisioning" state. This means that your
dedicated instance is being spun up in our infrastructure, and is not
immediately available. Let's wait for the instance to be in a running state
before continuing. This should take around a minute or two. There's no need to
refresh the page; our app polls the backend at regular intervals to update the
database status and connection info.

## Connecting to your database

Once your database is ready, you can click the "Connect" tab for instructions on
how to connect to it. Since there are several different, and possibly
unfamiliar, ways to connect to a QuestDB instance, I'll briefly review each one
below (in order of appearance on the page).

### Web Console

The [Web Console](/docs/develop/web-console/) is an integrated web-based
frontend that is built into the database itself. It can act as a scratchpad for
testing out queries, allow you to visualize table schemas, and even import data
directly into the database from a CSV file.

<Screenshot
  alt="QuestDB Cloud Web Console"
  title="Web Console"
  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/web-console.webp"
/>

SQL is a first-class citizen here at QuestDB. The Web Console accepts ANSI SQL
queries, augmented by our own set of
[custom SQL extensions](/docs/concept/sql-extensions/) that are optimized for
time-series analysis.

The Web Console also supports data ingestion from a CSV file, with a brand-new
CSV import interface released in
[version 7.1.2](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/tag/7.1.2). This
interface provides several features for you to customize your import, including
data overwrite vs append modes and the ability to set your new table's
partitioning strategy.

  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/csv.webp"
/>

Now that we've covered the web console, let's discuss the next connection type,
which will allow you to programmatically ingest data into your database...

### InfluxDB Line Protocol

If you're looking to take advantage of the many performance optimizations our
team has been working on, then the
[InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP)](/docs/reference/api/ilp/overview/) is for you! In
fact, it's our most-recommended method for ingesting data into the database.

ILP is a
[text-based protocol](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.7/reference/syntax/line-protocol/)
used to write time-series data to a data store. It's a line-delimited protocol
that represents data on a datapoint-per-line basis using a simple syntax
specification.

But we haven't just implemented the existing protocol; we've also added features
to the protocol itself!

For instance, to secure connections to your database, we've added authentication
over TCP using a JWK for ILP connections. This feature is enabled for every
cloud database. You can find your instance's JWK private key on the database
detail page in the "Security" section.

<Screenshot
  alt="QuestDB Cloud JWK Security"
  title="Database security"
  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/jwk.webp"
/>

Now that you have the private key, how do you actually start using ILP? Moving
back to the Connections tab, one of my favorite things about the platform is how
we automatically generate working code examples, using our own
performance-optimized libraries, that will open up a connection to your database
and send some sample data points. Here is an example of connecting over ILP
using our [Golang client](https://github.com/questdb/go-questdb-client).

<Screenshot
  alt="Connect over ILP using Golang"
  title="Connect over ILP using Golang"
  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/connect-ilp-golang.webp"
/>

In this code sample (below where the screenshot cuts off), we fill in all of the
authentication details for you, based on your connection method of choice. Our
provided snippets should work as-is, with no modifications necessary!

Please keep in mind that you will eventually want to store these credentials as
environment variables or secrets, instead of hardcoded in your codebase. It's
important to keep your database's credentials safe! But this feature still makes
it a breeze to connect to your new instance.

Finally, it's important to note that you don't have to _create_ any tables in
QuestDB to start using ILP! Our ILP implementation dynamically generates table
schemas based on the data that QuestDB is receiving over the wire. If a table
does not exist, it is automatically created with a daily
[partition strategy](/docs/concept/partitions/) by default. If a subsequent line
does not include a field, a `NULL` is inserted into the table for that record.
And if the database encounters a column that it hasn't seen before in a given
table, the table is modified to add the new column. See the
[ILP behavior section](/docs/reference/api/ilp/overview#behavior) in our docs
for more information.

### PostgreSQL Wire Protocol

Not only can you run SQL queries in the web console, but you can also connect to
the database using a standard PostgreSQL client over the
[Postgres Wire Protocol](/docs/reference/api/postgres/), which most PostgreSQL
clients and code libraries implement. Using the same connection semantics as you
would for a normal PostgreSQL database (host, port, username, password, etc),
you can point your client (or library) to your QuestDB's PostgreSQL endpoint and
execute DML and DDL queries against the database. Just make sure that your
client supports SSL, since it is used for all endpoints in our platform.

Just as we do for ILP, we also have a set of working code examples using common
programming languages and their standard PostgreSQL libraries. These code
examples use your database's actual endpoint and credentials, so they should
require absolutely no modification to work. Your PostgreSQL username and
password can also be found in the "Security" section on the database detail
page.

I suggest using the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol if data ingestion speed is not your
primary concern, or you require transactional support, which is not included in
ILP. On the client side, ILP can be trickier than PostgreSQL to implement, which
could also increase your application development time. So if you want to get
started quickly by ingesting data into your database, PostgreSQL might be the
right protocol for you. Finally, since ILP is a write-only interface, PostgreSQL
is the only way to get data _out_ of QuestDB.

### HTTP REST API

If you don't have access to a SQL client, you can also execute SQL commands
against the database's [REST API](/docs/reference/api/rest/). This is the same
API that powers the Web Console, so any query that you run there will also be
valid using the API.

The REST API uses HTTP basic authentication, and the credentials are the same as
they are for PostgreSQL connections above. Here's a sample query to demonstrate
how easy it is to get started:

<Screenshot
  alt="REST API query"
  title="Curl query"
  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/curl.webp"
/>

If you're working in a controlled environment that doesn't have access to a
PostgreSQL driver or client, but need to programmatically query data from your
database, our REST API endpoints are perfect for you.

## Additional Features

In addition to the connectivity information, we also provide other features for
our customers to use! I'll talk about each one briefly, leaving the in-depth
details for further tutorials.

### Monitoring

If you click the "Monitoring" tab, you will see time-series data for a few key
metrics: CPU usage, disk usage, and memory usage for your instance.

<Screenshot
  alt="Database metrics"
  title="Database metrics"
  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/metrics.webp"
/>

Here's a fun fact: these metrics are actually served by a QuestDB instance
running in our cluster! Check out our article on
[how we accomplished this in our Kubernetes-based infrastructure](/blog/questdb-cloud-metrics-kubernetes/).

We also stream database logs to the monitoring page. These can be filtered by
date and hour, as well as copied to the clipboard for your convenience.

<Screenshot
  alt="Database logs"
  title="Database logs"
  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/logs.webp"
/>

_Note: All times for metrics and logs are in UTC._

### Snapshots

On the "Snapshots" tab, you have the option to create a new daily snapshot
schedule or a one-off snapshot of your database.

<Screenshot
  alt="Snapshots"
  title="Snapshots"
  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/snapshots.webp"
/>

Snapshots can be restored either into a new database (if you have the spare
capacity for another one), or restored into the existing instance from which it
was taken, assuming that it is still running. It's also important to note that
when restoring a snapshot into the same instance, all data starting from after
the point at which the snapshot was taken will be destroyed.

## Project ideas

Now that you can connect to your database, and are familiar with some of the
basic QuestDB Cloud features, you're all set to go on your next time-series data
adventure! Here are some neat project ideas that we've previously featured on
our website:

- [Time-Series Data Visualization with Apache Superset and QuestDB](/blog/time-series-data-visualization-apache-superset-and-questdb/)
- [Ingesting Financial Tick Data Using a Time-Series Database](/blog/ingesting-financial-tick-data-using-time-series-database/)
- [Crypto Data Visualization Dashboards with Grafana](/blog/crypto-data-visualization-dashboards-grafana/)
- [Time-Series Monitoring Dashboard with Grafana and QuestDB](/blog/time-series-monitoring-dashboard-grafana-questdb/)

## Cleaning up

QuestDB Cloud bills based on usage, so we recommend spinning down databases to
avoid paying for unused resources.

<Screenshot
  alt="Danger zone"
  title="Danger zone"
  src="/img/blog/2023-06-01/danger-zone.webp"
/>

As you can see in the "Danger Zone" on our database detail page (cue the Top Gun
music...), you have the option to either Pause or Delete your instance.

### Pausing your instance

When you pause your instance, we spin down your database's computing and
networking resources but leave your data's volume intact. The instance will no
longer be running and you will not be able to connect to it, but your data will
still be safely persisted on disk. You can always re-access your data by
starting the database back up again.

Keep in mind, if you choose this option, you will still be paying for the cost
of data storage.

### Deleting your instance

If you delete your database, all resources (except for snapshots) are
permanently deleted. This includes the volume that is housing your data. Once a
database is deleted, there will be no additional cost to you.

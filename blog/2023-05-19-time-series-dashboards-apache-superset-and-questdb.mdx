## Data visualization for time-series data

One of the most common uses of a time-series database is visualizing data on a
dashboard to inform business decisions. This tutorial will show you how to
connect QuestDB and Apache Superset. QuestDB is an open-source time-series
database and Apache Superset is an open-source data exploration and
visualization platform. By combining these, you can create a dashboard
displaying data from multiple tables.

## Installing and starting QuestDB

If you are not yet using QuestDB, or if you are using a version lower than
7.1.2, please refer to [our documentation](/docs/get-started/docker/). In my
case, I start a QuestDB instance (with ephemeral storage) using Docker:

```shell
docker run \
  -p 9000:9000 -p 9009:9009 -p 8812:8812 -p 9003:9003 \
  questdb/questdb:7.1.2
```

## The datasets

We will be working with two datasets that we need to download and import into
QuestDB. The first one represents taxi rides in the city of New York. The
[original dataset](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
is very large. Therefore, we are going to work with a subset that represents a
few minutes of taxi rides on January 1st, 2018. You can download and import
[the dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javier/questdb-quickstart/main/trips.csv)
from the command line using curl:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javier/questdb-quickstart/main/trips.csv > trips_2018.csv
curl -F data=@trips_2018.csv 'http://localhost:9000/imp?overwrite=false&name=trips_2018&timestamp=pickup_datetime&partitionBy=DAY'
```

The second dataset represents energy consumption and next-day forecast at
15-minute intervals for a few European countries. We have curated a subset of
the [original dataset](https://data.open-power-system-data.org/time_series/)
containing
[data for 2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javier/questdb-quickstart/main/energy_2018.csv).
Download the data and import it to QuestDB with:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javier/questdb-quickstart/main/energy_2018.csv > energy_2018.csv
curl -F schema='[{"name":"timestamp", "type": "TIMESTAMP", "pattern": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"}]' -F data=@energy_2018.csv 'http://localhost:9000/imp?overwrite=false&name=energy_2018&timestamp=timestamp&partitionBy=MONTH'
```

If you visit your QuestDB web interface at `http://localhost:9000`, you should
see the two new tables. You should have 999 rows in the `trips_2018` table and
205189 rows in the `energy_2018` table.

```questdb-sql
SELECT COUNT() FROM trips_2018;
SELECT COUNT() FROM energy_2018;
```

## Installing and starting Apache Superset

You will also need a working installation of Apache Superset with the
QuestDB-Connect module installed. See
[Superset integration](/docs/third-party-tools/superset/) for more details. I
choose Docker to run Superset, and these are the steps to install it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/superset.git
cd superset
touch ./docker/requirements-local.txt
echo "questdb-connect==0.0.54" >> ./docker/requirements-local.txt
docker-compose build --force-rm
docker-compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up
```

By default, your Apache Superset runs at `http://localhost:8088`.

Apache Superset must be initialized when started for the first time. This
includes setting up default databases and sample datasets. This process may take
some time before it is fully functional.

## Connecting QuestDB and Superset

In Superset you create charts that you add to dashboards. Charts get their data
from different databases, so the first step is to configure the database
connections you will use. In our case, we need to configure a single connection
to QuestDB.

Superset supports a wide range of databases by default. QuestDB is not one of
them, but since we installed the
[questdb-connect module](https://github.com/questdb/questdb-connect), we can add
the connection by following these steps:

- From the [Superset web interface](http://localhost:8088), select `Settings` >
  `Database Connections`
- Select `+ DATABASE` to add the following parameters:

_SUPPORTED DATABASES_: `Other` / _DISPLAY NAME_: `QuestDB`

_SQLALCHEMY URI_: `questdb://admin:quest@host.docker.internal:8812/qdb`

Note that I use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` because I started
Superset from Docker. If you are running Superset outside of Docker, you would
need to use `localhost` instead.

## Creating a dataset

Before you create a chart, Superset requires you to create a dataset. In its
simplest form, a dataset represents a table in your database. Still, you can
also add calculated columns, or create a dataset from a complex SQL statement
that references one or more tables.

For the first dataset, let's use the `trips_2018` table we created earlier.

- From the [Superset web interface](http://localhost:8088), select `Datasets` >
  `+ DATASET`
- Select QuestDB as the `DATABASE` and `trips_2018` as the table. A list of
  columns is displayed.
- Click `CREATE DATASET AND CREATE CHART`

There is also the optional step to edit the dataset by selecting `Datasets`. You
can remove columns and add calculated columns or metadata.

/>

## Creating your first chart

At this point, you should see a dialog to select a visualization type. 

If not, select the `Charts` link at the top of the Superset
web interface and click the name of the dataset we created in the previous
step.

We're now ready to create a chart.

Superset has many types of charts. One of the simplest charts is the `Table`
chart. If you cannot find the thumbnail, you can always type `Table` in the
search box or navigate through the different types of charts using the
categories on the left.

When you select the `Table` type and `CREATE NEW CHART`, you should see
the `Chart` dialog. This is virtually the same for all the charts, with
different options depending on the chart type.

At the top of this dialog, there are two tabs: one for defining the data to display, and one for customizing the chart appearance.

For this first chart, we want to display the total number of entries, the
average trip distance, and the average total amount paid, grouped by vendor, cab
type, and rate code:

- Add `vendor_id`, `cab_type`, and `rate_code_id` as dimensions by dragging
  columns or by clicking on the `DIMENSIONS` box
- Add `COUNT(*)`, `AVG(trip_distance)`, and `AVG(total_amount)` using the
  `METRICS` box
- Add `AVG(total_amount)` to the `PERCENTAGE METRICS` box, so we can see how
  much of the total each row in the table contributes
- Uncheck the `SORT DESCENDING` option
- Click `UPDATE CHART`

Your screen should look very similar to the screenshot below:

  alt="Superset screenshot when creating the table chart"

  src="/img/blog/2023-05-19/create_table_chart.webp"
  width={1056}
/>

To save the chart, select `SAVE` in the top right. Choose a name (e.g., "Trips
Stats"), and the name of a new dashboard (e.g., "QuestDB Demo"). Click
`SAVE AND GO TO DASHBOARD`.

Congrats. You have just created your first chart and dashboard.

If you want to spice up the dashboard by adding headings, links, images, tabs,
dividers, etc., click `EDIT DASHBOARD` and play around with the layout. Check
the
[Superset documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/exploring-data/#dashboard-basics)
for more information.

## Creating a dataset from a SQL statement

We will now add a new dataset, but in this case, we want to use QuestDB-specific
SQL, such as [`SAMPLE BY`](/docs/reference/sql/sample-by/). We can do this by
creating a dataset from a SQL statement. Select `SQL` > `SQL Lab` and type the
following query in the SQL box:

```questdb-sql
SELECT timestamp, country_code, SUM(load_forecast) AS daily_forecast,
       SUM(load_actual) AS daily_actual
FROM energy_2018
SAMPLE BY 1d ALIGN TO CALENDAR;
```

Click `RUN` to see the results. The `energy_2018` table contains data in
15-minute intervals, and we use `SAMPLE BY` to get the total usage and forecast
per day and country.

Click the arrow by the `SAVE` button, select `SAVE DATASET`, type the name
`energy_sampled_1d`, and then click `SAVE AND EXPLORE`.

You should now see the `Chart` dialog. Ignore any error messages you see on the
next screen, as they will disappear as we add some fields and update the chart.

Click the `view all charts` link and look for the `Mixed Chart` type, which
allows us to represent line, bar, and area charts for different series on a
single chart. We will use it to plot the actual versus projected energy
consumption by country.

This time, the chart dialog has more options than before.

Let's select the `timestamp` column for the `Shared query fields` section,
`SUM(daily_actual)` as the `Query A` metric, `country_code` as the `Query A`
dimension, `SUM(daily_forecast)` as the `Query B` metric, and `country_code` as
the `Query B` dimension. Uncheck `SORT DESCENDING` for `A` and `B` queries,
and click `UPDATE CHART`.

If all goes well, you will see a line chart representing the energy data. Click
`SAVE`, name the chart (e.g., "Energy Forecast"), and add it to your existing
dashboard.

## Wrapping up

Apache Superset is a complete tool for creating data visualizations. In
this post, we have connected QuestDB to Apache Superset and added some basic
charts. There are many more charts and options you can use.

The next step is to explore the Superset documentation. You can learn how to
create business dashboards for both batch and real-time scenarios.

We encourage you to share some of your dashboards with
our [Slack Community](https://slack.questdb.io/). You can also play with
our [live demo](https://demo.questdb.io/) to execute queries on demo datasets.
Of course, contributions to our
open-source [projects on GitHub](https://github.com/questdb) are more than
welcome.

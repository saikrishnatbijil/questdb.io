## Introduction to time-series databases

Time-series data is emerging as the dominant type of data produced in IoT,
financial services, manufacturing, DevOps, monitoring, and machine learning.
[Time-series databases](/glossary/time-series-database/) are specialized for
storing and analyzing this kind of data efficiently and quickly. This article
compares QuestDB with InfluxDB to help understand the key differences so you can
choose a time-series database that fits your use case.

The typical uses of time-series databases are for:

- Application performance, uptime, and response times
- Analyzing financial transactions and trades
- Monitoring network logs
- Asset tracking
- E-commerce transaction data, sales insights, BI reports
- Sensor data from IoT devices

While the traditional use of databases was to store the last-known state of a
system, this only shows a snapshot of a point in time. In contrast, time-series
data adds a historical dimension to help understand how information changes.

Understanding how data changes over time helps you predict your data, gain
deeper insights into trends, and be better prepared for future variations. For
this reason, developers need a time-series database that's robust, easy to use,
and powerful. Importantly, it must be flexible enough to be used across
different scenarios, industries, and use cases.

## Introduction to InfluxDB and QuestDB

Released in 2013, InfluxDB is an open-source time-series database subject to the
MIT license. Both open-source versions of InfluxDB (v1 and v2) are implemented
in Go.

QuestDB is an open-source time-series database licensed under Apache License
2.0. It is designed for high throughput ingestion and fast SQL queries. It
supports schema-agnostic ingestion using the InfluxDB line protocol, PostgreSQL
wire protocol, and a REST API for bulk imports and exports.

A brief comparison based on DB-Engines:

| Name                          | InfluxDB                                                   | QuestDB                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary database model        | Time Series DBMS                                           | Time Series DBMS                                           |

| APIs and other access methods | HTTP API (including InfluxDB Line Protocol), JSON over UDP | InfluxDB Line Protocol, Postgres Wire Protocol, HTTP, JDBC |

## What are the data models used in InfluxDB and QuestDB?

One of the first places to compare QuestDB and InfluxDB is how data is handled
and stored in each database. InfluxDB has a dedicated line protocol message
format for ingesting measurements. Each measurement has a timestamp, a set of
tags (a tagset), and a set of fields (a fieldset):

```txt
measurementName,tagKey=tagValue fieldKey="fieldValue" 1465839830100399000
--------------- --------------- --------------------- -------------------
       |               |                  |                    |
  Measurement         Tags              Fields             Timestamp
```

In InfluxDB, tagset values are indexed strings, while fieldset values are not
indexed. The data types that fields may use are limited to floats, integers,
strings, and booleans. The following snippet is an example message in the
InfluxDB line protocol:

```
sensors,location=london,version=REV-2.1 temperature=22,humidity=50 1465839830100399000\n
```

QuestDB supports the
[InfluxDB line protocol](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/api/ilp/overview/)
(ILP) for compatibility purposes, so inserts using the ILP supports the same
data types. QuestDB supports additional numeric types, such as BYTE for 8-bit
integers, FLOAT for 32-bit floats, LONG256 for larger integers, UUID for
identifiers, and GEOHASH for geospatial data. Additional types can be used while
ingesting InfluxDB line protocol by creating a table with a desired schema
before writing data.

QuestDB also exposes PostgreSQL wire protocol and a REST API for inserts,
allowing for more control over the data types that the system can handle,
including additional types such as date, char, and binary. In QuestDB, it's also
possible to add indexes to existing columns in tables, which can be done
directly through SQL:

```questdb-sql
ALTER TABLE sensors ALTER COLUMN firmware ADD INDEX;
```

QuestDB has full support for relational queries, whereas InfluxDB is a NoSQL,
non-relational database with a custom data model. QuestDB supports both
schema-agnostic ingestions over InfluxDB line protocol and a relational data
model. Users can leverage both paradigms and perform SQL JOINs to correlate
"schemaless" data with relational data by timestamp.

## Comparing database storage models

For storage, InfluxDB uses Time-Structured Merge (TSM) Trees, where data is
stored in a columnar format, and the storage engine stores differences (or
_deltas_) between values in a series. InfluxDB uses a time-series index for
indexing to keep queries fast as cardinality grows. Still, the efficiency of
this index has its limitations, explored in more detail below.

QuestDB uses columnar data structures but indexes data in vector-based
append-only column files. Sorting of out-of-order data occurs in a staging area
in memory, while sorted and persisted data is merged later using an append
model. The main motivation for merging with persisted data in this way is to
keep the storage engine performant on both read and write operations.

InfluxDB has a shard group concept as a partitioning strategy, allowing for
grouping data by time. Users can provide a
[shard group duration](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.7/reference/internals/shards/#shard-group-duration)
which defines how large a shard will be and can enable common operations such as
retention periods for data (deleting data older than X days, for example):

<Screenshot

  height={385}
  src="/img/blog/2021-11-29/shard-groups.webp"
  title="Shard groups in InfluxDB"
  width={850}
/>

QuestDB has similar functionality to partition tables by time, and users may
specify a partition size. When tables are partitioned by time, table metadata is
defined once per table, and column files are partitioned at the filesystem level
into directories per partition:

<Screenshot
  alt="A diagram showing the column-based storage model of QuestDB"
  height={385}
  src="/img/blog/2021-11-29/questdb-storage-model.webp"
  title="QuestDB's column-based storage model"
  width={850}
/>

Both QuestDB and InfluxDB have ways to partition data by time and employ a
retention strategy. The difference in partitioning for each system is the
broader terminology and the fact that QuestDB does not need to create
[separate TSM files on disk](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.7/reference/internals/shards/#shards)
per partition.

## Ease of use of SQL compared to custom query languages

The emergence of NoSQL as a popular paradigm has effectively split databases
into two categories: SQL and NoSQL.

InfluxDB originally started with a language similar to SQL called InfluxQL,
which balanced some aspects of SQL with custom syntax. InfluxDB eventually
adopted Flux as a query language to interact with data.

QuestDB embraces SQL as the primary query language so that there is no need for
learning custom query languages. SQL is a good choice for time-series databases;
it's easy to understand, most developers are familiar with it already, and SQL
skills are simple to apply across different systems. As reported by the
[Stack Overflow developer survey of 2022](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language),
it's the third most popular language developers use. It proves to be a
long-standing choice for quickly asking questions about the characteristics of
your data.

Flux enables you to work with InfluxDB more efficiently, but it's difficult to
read, and it's harder to learn and onboard new users. From users' perspective,
learning a new custom query language is inconvenient for accessibility
regardless of their engineering background.

```javascript
from(bucket:"example-bucket")
  |> range(start:-1h)
  |> filter(fn:(r) =>
    r._measurement == "cpu" and
    r.cpu == "cpu-total"
  )
  |> aggregateWindow(every: 1m, fn: mean)
```

Consider that the Flux query above can be written in SQL as follows:

```questdb-sql
SELECT avg(cpu),
       avg(cpu-total)
FROM 'example-bucket'
WHERE timestamp > dateadd('h', -1, now())
SAMPLE BY 1m;
```

## Benchmark

Let's compare how QuestDB and InfluxDB operate in terms of performance for both
ingestion and querying. As usual, we use the industry standard
[Time Series Benchmark Suite (TSBS)](https://github.com/timescale/tsbs) as the
benchmark tool. Unfortunately, TSBS upstream does not support InfluxDB v2.
Hence, we use our own [TSBS fork](https://github.com/questdb/tsbs).

The hardware we use for the benchmark is the following:

- c6a.12xlarge EC2 instance with 48 vCPU and 96 GB RAM
- 500GB gp3 volume configured for the maximum settings (16,000 IOPS and 1,000
  MB/s throughput)

The software side of the benchmark is the following:

- Ubuntu 22.04
- InfluxDB 2.7.1 with the default configuration
- QuestDB 7.1.3 with the default configuration

### Ingestion

To benchmark ingestion, we used commands like the following one:

```bash
$ ./tsbs_generate_data --use-case="cpu-only" --seed=123 --scale=1000 --timestamp-start="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" --timestamp-end="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" --log-interval="10s" --format="influx" > /tmp/influx_data

$ ./tsbs_load_influx --db-name=benchmark --file=/tmp/influx_data --urls=http://localhost:8086 --auth-token="<auth_token>" --workers=10
```

Here, we use a `cpu-only` scenario with two days of CPU data for various numbers
of simulated hosts. The number of hosts is set to 100, 1K, 100K, and 10M to
demonstrate the effects of high data cardinality on ingestion performance. We
use ten client connections for the benchmark in both cases.

The chart below summarizes the results for ingestion performance:

<Screenshot
  alt="Ingestion results comparing QuestDB and InfluxDB using the time series benchmark suite"
  height={385}
  src="/img/blog/2021-11-29/timeseries-benchmark-high-cardinality.webp"
  title="Ingestion rate (rows/sec) comparison between InfluxDB and QuestDB"
  width={650}
/>

QuestDB hits maximum ingestion throughput of 1.69M rows/sec versus 524K rows/sec
for InfluxDB. For 10M unique devices, QuestDB sustains 663K rows/sec, versus 66K
rows/sec for InfluxDB. The latter illustrates the effects of high cardinality on
InfluxDB's ingestion performance.

Cardinality typically refers to the number of unique elements in a set's size.
In a time-series database context, high cardinality boils down to many indexed
columns in a table, each containing many unique values.

High cardinality is a known problem area for InfluxDB, and this is likely
because of the system architecture and storage engine. InfluxDB stores each time
series in its own Time-Structured Merge tree, a
[log-structured merge (LSM) tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree)-like
persistent data structure, so reading and writing the data becomes more
expensive when the total number of time series becomes high. In QuestDB, the
storage model is completely different from LSM trees or
[B-trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) and instead uses data stored in
densely ordered vectors on disk. As such, QuestDB deals with high cardinality
datasets better.

### Query performance

While QuestDB outperforms InfluxDB for ingestion, query performance is equally
essential for time-series data analysis.

As part of the standard TSBS benchmark, we compare both databases for a few
types of queries, which are popular for time-series data:

<Screenshot
  alt="Query breakdown for the benchmark"
  height={385}
  src="/img/blog/2021-11-29/query.webp"
  title="Query breakdown for the benchmark"
  width={850}
/>

All queries were run for two weeks of 4K emulated host data. Here are some
sample commands to generate and run the queries:

```bash
$ ./tsbs_generate_queries --use-case="cpu-only" --seed=123 --scale=4000 --timestamp-start="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" --timestamp-end="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" --queries=1000 --query-type="single-groupby-1-1-1" --format="influx" > /tmp/influx_query_single-groupby-1-1-1

$ ./tsbs_run_queries_influx --file=/tmp/influx_query_single-groupby-1-1-1 --auth-token="<auth_token>" --workers=10
```

Again, we use ten concurrent client connections for the comparison. We measure
how much time each query takes in milliseconds:

<Screenshot
  alt="Query performance results comparing QuestDB and InfluxDB using the time series benchmark suite"
  height={385}
  src="/img/blog/2021-11-29/timeseries-benchmark-suite-results.webp"
  title="Query performance (milliseconds/query) comparison between InfluxDB and QuestDB"
  width={850}
/>

Two conclusions from the benchmark:

- InfluxDB performs better for queries that access the data for a single or a
  few nodes, such as `single-groupby-1-8-1` and `cpu-max-all-1`.
- QuestDB outperforms InfluxDB significantly for more complicated queries
  touching the data for many or all nodes.

QuestDB's underperformance for queries on a single or a few nodes can be
explained with index-based data access. Since there are many node measurements
(think, time series) stored in the table, fetching values that belong to a
concrete node assumes a random disk access pattern. Of course, this stands true
only for so-called cold query execution, i.e. a situation when the data is not
in the OS page cache. Once the data is in the cache, disk I/O doesn't matter
anymore. We plan to improve cold execution for such queries significantly with
the [sub-partitioning](https://github.com/questdb/roadmap/issues/45) feature.
This way, multiple symbol column values (think, nodes) will be stored in smaller
column files, leading to a sequential access pattern and, hence, better
performance for queries accessing only a single or a few symbols.

For more complicated queries, QuestDB's better performance lies in its query
engine: it takes advantage of a columnar data layout,
[SIMD instructions](https://questdb.io/blog/2020/04/02/using-simd-to-aggregate-billions-of-rows-per-second/),
and multi-threaded processing.

## Ecosystem and support

QuestDB is a younger database. However, QuestDB builds on the immensely
popular SQL language and is compatible with the
[Postgres wire protocol](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/api/postgres/). It
also borrows from InfluxDB by implementing InfluxDB line protocol over TCP, a
convenient option for fast data ingestion. In addition, QuestDB has a vibrant
and supportive community: users get to interact with the engineering team
building QuestDB.

InfluxDB has an impressive ecosystem and has been around for a long time. As an
older product, InfluxDB is the most popular time-series database.

## Conclusion

We have compared InfluxDB and QuestDB, assessing performance and user
experience. QuestDB ingests data 3-10 times faster, and many benchmarked queries
perform better.

We believe in the simplicity of SQL to unlock insights from time-series data.
Some of the SQL extensions that QuestDB offers, such as
[SAMPLE BY](/docs/reference/sql/sample-by/), can significantly reduce the
complexity of queries and improve developer user experience.

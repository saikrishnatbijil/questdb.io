# What Is Database Partitioning?

Database partitioning (or data partitioning) is a technique used to split data
in a large database into smaller chunks called partitions. Each partition is
then stored and accessed separately to improve the performance and scalability
of the database system.

Database partitioning strategies apply to different types of databases such as
SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB,
Cassandra), or time-series databases like QuestDB.

## Advantages of database partitioning

The primary motivation for database partitioning is to improve the performance
and scalability of large databases by distributing the data that can be accessed
independently.

By dividing the data into partitions, databases can avoid reading from
partitions that are not needed for queries that only need a subset of the data
collocated in a partition. This allows the database to reduce expensive disk I/O
calls and return the data much quicker.

## Database partitioning vs. sharding

Database partitioning deals with a single database instance, whereas sharding
splits partitions (shards) across multiple database instances for scalability
and availability.

When a database is sharded, partitions are stored and managed by discrete
servers that may run in different VMs, zones, or regions. Shards can even be
replicated across servers to service more requests concurrently.

Finally, individual shards can be backed up, restored, or repaired independently
to minimize the impact of hardware failures on a single database.

## Types of database partitioning

There are two major types of database partitioning approaches:

### Vertical partitioning

In vertical partitioning, columns of a table are divided into partitions with
each partition containing one or more columns from the table. This approach is
useful when some columns are accessed more frequently than others.

Data partitioning is often combined with sharding: frequently accessed columns
may be split into different partitions and sharded to run on discrete servers.
Alternatively, columns that are rarely used may be partitioned to a cheaper and
slower storage solution to reduce the I/O overhead.

One of the downsides to vertical partitioning is that when a query needs to span
multiple partitions, combining the results from those partitions may be slow or
complicated. Also, as the database scales, partitions may need to be split even
further to meet the demand.

### Horizontal partitioning

On the other hand, horizontal partitioning works by splitting the table by rows
based on the partition key. In this approach, each row of the table is assigned
to a partition based on some criteria, which include:

- **Range-based partitioning**: data is split based on a range that does not
  overlap. The most common example is partitioning by time on time-series
  workloads. Data can be partitioned by some time interval (e.g., daily, weekly,
  monthly) to aid range-based search. Old partitions can easily be archived to
  serve queries for newer ranges more efficiently.

- **List-based partitioning**: data is split based on discrete sets of values,
  usually from a particular column.

  For example, a table containing sales data may be partitioned by geo-regions
  such as North America or Asia-Pacific regions. Partitions may be further split
  into subsections.

- **Hash-based partitioning**: data is split based on some hashing algorithm.
  Hash-based partitioning applies a hash function to one or more columns to
  determine which partition to send the request to.

  For example, we may use a simple modulo function on the employee id field or
  use a complicated cryptographic hashing function on an IP address to divide
  the data. When a non-trivial hash function is used, hash-based partitioning
  tends to distribute the data evenly across partitions. However, depending on
  the function, adding or removing a new partition may require an expensive
  migration process.

- **Composite partitioning**: any of the aforementioned methods can be combined. For
  example, a time-series workload may first be partitioned by time and further
  split based on another column field.

One thing to note with horizontal partitioning is that the performance depends
heavily on how evenly distributed the data is across the partitions. If the
data distribution is skewed, the partition with the most records will become
the bottleneck.

Also, most analytical databases employ horizontal partitioning strategies over
vertical partitioning. Some popular file formats such as
[Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/) support
partitioning natively, making it ideal for big data processing.

## Partitioning in QuestDB

QuestDB supports
[data partitioning](https://questdb.io/docs/concept/partitions/) by intervals
of time, including hour, day, week, month, and year. Tables that are partitioned
by time perform better for timestamp interval searches, as QuestDBâ€™s SQL
optimizer leverages partitioning to reduce disk I/O.

QuestDB also supports
[attaching](/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-attach-partition/) or
[detaching](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-detach-partition/)
partitions to archive data for storage optimization.

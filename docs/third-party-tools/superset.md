[Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) is a popular open-source
business intelligence web application that enables users to visualize and
explore data through customizable dashboards and reports.

QuestDB provides the
[QuestDB Connect](https://pypi.org/project/questdb-connect/) python package that
implements the SQLAlchemy dialect and Superset engine specification, to
integrate Apache Superset with QuestDB.

## Installing Apache Superset via Docker (recommended)

We recommend the Docker-based Apache Superset installation. You will need to
install the following requirements:

- Docker
- QuestDB 7.1.2 or later

Then, following the steps below:

1. Clone the [Superset repo](https://github.com/apache/superset):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/superset.git
```

2. Change your directory:

   ```bash
   cd superset
   ```

3. Create a file `docker/requirements-local.txt` with the requirement to
   `questdb-connect`:

```bash
touch ./docker/requirements-local.txt
echo "questdb-connect==1.0.6" > docker/requirements-local.txt
```
4. Run Apache Superset:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml pull
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up
   ```

   This step will initialize your Apache Superset installation, creating a
   default admin, users, and several other settings. The first time you start
   Apache Superset it can take a few minutes until it is completely initialized.
   Please keep an eye on the console output to see when Apache Superset is ready
   to be used.

## Installing Superset via QuestDB Connect

If you have a stand-alone installation of Apache Superset and are using Apache
Superset without Docker, you need to install the following requirements :

- Python from 3.9 to 3.11
- [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-from-scratch/)
- QuestDB 7.1.2 or later

Install QuestDB Connect using `pip`:

```bash
pip install 'questdb-connect==1.0.6'
```

## Connecting QuestDB to Superset

Once installed and initialized, Apache Superset is accessible via
`localhost:8088`.

1. Sign in with the following details:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin
2. From Superset UI, select Setting > Database Connections
3. Select `+Database` to add the following parameters:
   - SUPPORTED DATABASES: Other
   - DISPLAY NAME: QuestDB
   - SQLALCHEMY URI: `questdb://admin:quest@host.docker.internal:8812/qdb`
4. For the `SQLALCHEMY URI` field, use `host.docker.internal` when running
   Apache Superset from Docker and `localhost` for outside of Docker.
5. Once connected, tables in QuestDB will be visible for creating Datasets in
   Apache Superset.

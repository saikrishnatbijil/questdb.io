In QuestDB 7.0, we added a new approach to ingest data using a write-ahead log
(WAL). This page introduces the properties of a WAL-enabled table (WAL table)
and compares it to a non-WAL table. It also contains a summary of key
components, relevant functions, as well as related SQL keywords.

## Properties

A WAL table must be [partitioned](/docs/concept/partitions/). It permits the
following concurrent transactions:

- Data ingestion through different interfaces
- Data modifications
- Table schema changes

### Enabling WAL and configurations

The following keywords enable WAL tables:

- WAL table creation via [`CREATE TABLE`](/docs/reference/sql/create-table/)

- Converting an existing table to a WAL table or vice versa via [`SET TYPE`](/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-set-type/) following a database restart.

- Server-wide configuration via `cairo.wal.enabled.default`
  - When `cairo.wal.enabled.default` is set to `true` (default), the
    [`CREATE TABLE`](/docs/reference/sql/create-table/) SQL keyword generates
    WAL tables without `WAL`. The `BYPASS WAL` keyword still works as expected.

Parallel threads to apply WAL data to the table storage can be configured, see
[WAL table configuration](/docs/reference/configuration/#wal-table-configurations)
for more details.

### Comparison

The following table highlights the main difference between a WAL and a non-WAL
table:

| WAL table                                                                                  | Non-WAL table                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Concurrent data ingestion via multiple interfaces                                          | ILP locks the table for ingestion; concurrent data ingestion via other interfaces is not allowed - `Table Busy`error |
| Unconstrained concurrent DDLs and DMLs                                                     | Concurrent DDLs and DMLs for ILP interface only                                                                      |
| Asynchronous operations - in rare situations there may be slight delays in data visibility | Synchronous operations - no-wait commits                                                                             |
| Improved data freshness for `DROP` and `RENAME` of the table with a system-wide lock       | No change                                                                                                            |
| Some [impacts](#limitations) on existing operations                                        | No change                                                                                                            |

### Limitations

:::note

We are working hard to reduce the below limitations.

:::

For a WAL table, the following existing operations may have different behaviors
from a non-WAL table:

- [`UPDATE`](/docs/reference/sql/update/)

  - No row count returned
  - No support for `JOIN`

- `ALTER TABLE`

  - [`ADD COLUMN`](/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-add-column/) can only add 1
    column per statement
  - Non-structural operations may fail silently. These are partition-level and
    configuration operations:

    - [`ATTACH PARTITION`](/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-attach-partition/)
    - [`DETACH PARTITION`](/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-detach-partition/)
    - [`DROP PARTITION`](/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-drop-partition/)
    - [`SET PARAM`](/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-set-param/)

## Key components

A WAL table uses the following components to manage concurrent commit requests:

- **WAL**: acts as a dedicated API for each ingestion interface. When data is
  ingested via multiple interfaces, dedicated `WALs` ensure that the table is
  not locked by one interface only.

- **Sequencer**: centrally manages transactions, providing a single source of
  truth. The sequencer generates unique `txn` numbers as transaction identifiers
  and keeps a log that tracks their allocation, preventing duplicates. This log
  is called `TransactionLog` and is stored in a meta file called `_txnlog`. See
  [root directory](/docs/concept/root-directory-structure/#db-directory) for
  more information.

- **WAL apply job**: collects the commit requests based on the unique `txn`
  numbers and sends them to the `TableWriter` to be committed.

- **TableWriter**: updates the database and resolves any out-of-order data
  writes.

## Checking WAL configurations

The following table metadata functions are useful for checking WAL table
settings:

- [`tables()`](/docs/reference/function/meta/#tables) returns general table
  metadata, including whether a table is a WAL table or not.
- [`wal_tables()`](/docs/reference/function/meta/#wal_tables) returns WAL-table
  status.
- [ALTER TABLE RESUME WAL](/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-resume-wal/) restarts
  suspended transactions.

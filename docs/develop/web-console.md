  How to use the Web Console in QuestDB for importing, querying, and visualizing
  data.
---

The Web Console is a client that allows you to interact with QuestDB. It
provides UI tools to query data and visualize the results in a table or plot.

## Accessing the Web Console

The Web Console will be available at `http://[server-address]:9000`. When
running locally, this will be `http://localhost:9000`.

### System tables in Schema explorer

It is possible to hide QuestDB system tables (`telemetry` and
`telemetry_config`) in Schema explorer by setting up the following configuration
option in a [server.conf](/docs/concept/root-directory-structure/#serverconf)
file:

```bash title="/var/lib/questdb/conf/server.conf"
telemetry.hide.tables=true
```

## Code editor

The default panel shown in the web console is the code editor which allows you
to write and run SQL queries.

### Shortcuts

| Command       | Action                                                                      |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run query     | `f9` or `ctrl/cmd + enter`                                                  |
| Locate cursor | `f2`, use this to focus the SQL editor on your cursor in order to locate it |

### Behavior

As you can write multiple SQL commands separated by a semicolon, the Web Console
uses the following logic to decide which queries to execute:

- Check if a query or part of a query is highlighted. If yes, it will be
  executed, otherwise:
- Check if the cursor is within a SQL statement. If yes, the statement will be
  executed, otherwise:
- Check if the cursor is on the same line as a SQL statement and after the
  semicolon. If yes, this statement will be executed, finally:
- If the cursor is on a line that does not contain a SQL statement, the next
  encountered statement will be executed. If there is no statement after the
  cursor, the previous statement will be used.

### Visualizing results

You can run a query and click on the `Chart` button. This will display the chart
editor. You can then choose chart type, for example, `line` and then press
`Draw`.

### Toggle the grid table

The following options are available to toggle the grid layout:

  />

- Move the selected column to the front
- Reset grid layout
- Refresh

### Downloading results

You can download the query result by clicking the `CSV` button. This file will
be useful to test the import functionality below.

## Notification panel

The panel at the bottom of the web console shows the status of the most-recent
query. This panel can be toggled by clicking the up-arrow icon on the right of
the panel and shows the last 20 messages and notifications after query
execution.

## Import

The Web Console offers an interface to import small batches of CSV files as new
tables or to existing tables.

The import tab can be accessed by clicking this icon on the left-side navigation
menu:

### Import configurations

Once a file is added to the Upload queue, the following configurations will be
displayed:

<Screenshot
  alt="Screenshot of the Web Console showing the file ready to be uploaded"
  height={535}
  src="/img/docs/console/ready-to-upload.png"
  width={800}
/>

- `File`: The file name, size, and the import status
- `Table name`: The name for the table to be imported. By default, this is the
  name of the imported file.
- `Schema`: The Colum data name and data type. The schema is automatically
  detected but it is possible to set it manually. See
  [Table schema](#table-schema) for more information.
- `Write mode`:
  - `Append`: Uploaded data will be appended to the end of the table.
  - `Overwrite`: Uploaded data will override existing data in the table
- `Actions`:
  - `Settings`: Additional configuration for the import. See
    [Import settings](#import-settings) for more information.
  - `Upload`: Start the upload
  - `X`: Delete the file from the Upload queue

#### Table schema

To update the schema of an existing table, select `Overwrite` write mode to
replace the rows and the partition unit with the CSV file. 

For an existing table, changing the table name allows importing it as a new
separate table.

The following setting is available for configuration for both existing and new table import:

| Setting              | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Partition            | Change the partition setting of the table.                                              |
| Designated timestamp | Electing a Designated timestamp. This is mandatory if the partition unit is not `NONE`. |
| Data type            | Define the data type. For timestamp, the timestamp format is mandatory and there is the option to elect the column as the designated timestamp. |

To update the schema of a new table, in addition to the above, the following
settings are also available for configuration:

| Setting       | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delete column | Click `x` to delete the column from the table.                                                                                                  |
| Add column    | At the end of the column list, select “Add column” to insert a new column into the table.                                                       |

The following table schema details are imported based on the csv file:

- The column order 
- The column name 

#### Import settings

The Settings panel displays the following configurations:

| Setting                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Default value |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Maximum number of uncommitted row | The size of the commit batch. A commit will be issued when this number is reached in the buffer. This setting is the same as `cairo.max.uncommitted.rows`. To avoid running out of memory during an import, set this value based on the RAM size of the machine. | 500000        |
| Delimiter                         | The delimiter character to parse the CSV file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Automatic     |
| Atomicity                         | Error behavior. Rejected rows or columns will be reported in the [Details](#import-details) panel after the import is completed.                                                                                                                                 | Skip column   |
| Force header                      | Whether to interpret the first line as the header. The result will be reported in the [Details](#import-details) panel after the import is completed.                                                                                                            | FALSE         |
| Skip line extra values            | Whether the parser should ignore extra values by ignoring the entire line. An extra value is something in addition to what is defined by the header.                                                                                                             | FALSE         |
| Durable                           | Whether the import should be resilient against OS errors and power losses by forcing the data to be fully persisted before sending a response back to the user.                                                                                                  | FALSE         |

### Import details

The import status is displayed in the file column. Once the action is completed,
the number of rows inserted is displayed alongside the `Details` tab:

<Screenshot
  alt="Screenshot of the Web Console showing number of row imported and the Details tab"
  height={535}
  src="/img/docs/console/import-complete.png"
  width={400}
/>

The `Details` panel lists rejected rows and errors in importing each column:

<Screenshot
  alt="Screenshot of the Web Console showing the import details"
  height={535}
  src="/img/docs/console/import-details.png"
  width={400}
/>

The details such as header forced, table name, and rejected rows are related to
the defined import settings. For example, setting Atomicity in Settings to Skip
row will result in skipped rows being reported in Rejected rows after the
import.

## Providing an asset path

It's possible to provide an asset path if QuestDB is being run from somewhere
that is not the server root. In this case, create a `.env` file in the UI
directory of QuestDB and provide the path to web console assets as follows:

```bash
ASSET_PATH=/path/to/questdb/ui
```

An
[example dotenv](https://github.com/questdb/ui/blob/main/packages/web-console/.env.example)
file is provided which can be renamed to `.env` and placed in QuestDB's UI
directory.
